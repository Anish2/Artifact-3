                Rip Van Winkle combines a realistic situation with certain fantastical elements that could warrant a classification of science fantasy. In addition, if the story is interpreted as an instance of time travel then it could be classified as simply science fiction; however, the story lacks scientific elements as it is presented in the times of colonial America. The prominent fantastical feature is the meeting of strange people who possess a potion-like liquor. Also, the story makes some connections to the founding story of the Hudson river. The strange people could be the ghost crew of Henry Hudson. In fact, this is hinted at in the story when it is rumored that Henry Hudson’s crew reappears every twenty years as a means to keep watch over the river. Furthermore, a ghost crew is clear evidence of a basic fantasy. Comically, after twenty years he develops a long beard, yet another element of fantasy. The issue is that one may claim that Rip Van Winkle is simply a realistic fantasy similar to a myth or legend. However, the science does not always have to be explained with precision to be present. Every single era has different scientific capabilities and understandings, so in that time Rip Van Winkle may have been a science fantasy.</p>
<p>In terms of structure Rip Van Winkle has the feel of a classic fantasy. The description of the setting and way the narrative is presented is fantasy-like. For example, Irving describes the Catskill Mountains as “fairy mountains” and he describes Rip as “a simple, good-natured man.” The mountains are described in a mythical way, so there is evidence of a mystical tone. Also, the black and white description of Rip is quite significant of a fantasy. Fantasies are known to oversimplify character traits to accurately present some message. There is less dialogue and more storytelling in fantasies which is also seen in Rip Van Winkle. The only instances of dialogue are interactions with the liquor person and the townspeople after his twenty-year slumber. The presence of all of these elements shows no doubt that Rip Van Winkle is a fantasy, and the science portion is subjective to the time period.</p>
<p>	As a side note, it should be noted that after twenty years Rip and his surroundings gained two versions of independence. Rip was freed from his nagging wife as he later learns that Dame Van Winkle died during his disappearance. More importantly, America was freed from the control of Britain. Rip was confused at first because George Washington was revered in place of King George, but this is obviously evidence of a power transition.

                “Sic Semper, Sic Semper, Sic Semper” by Douglas F. Warrick is a science fantasy story about a time traveler who makes an apartment inside of Lincoln’s head.  The time traveler is well versed in the realm of science, but seems to be lacking in the other areas of his life.  While inside Lincoln’s skull, the traveler notices his father’s corpse appear in the time travel machine.  Rather than get emotional about his dead father, the traveler simply tries to calculate why the corpse is there.  Warrick uses this to comment on the cold, calculating nature of science itself represented in this case by the traveler.  The time traveler can’t figure out why his father’s body showed up, but he traces the problem to have originated with himself.  This paradox created by Warrick is meant to show how even our own actions can be difficult to understand.  Finally, tired of trying to figure out why he brought his father back, the time traveler decides the best course of action is to use the time-reticulation chamber to travel into his own head and make an apartment.  The encounter with his father showed the time traveler that he did not want to die just yet, because there was another problem that he wanted to solve.  This exemplifies the ever-present nature of questions in life, resulting in the never-ending quest by science to solve these questions.  The time traveler continuously living inside his own mind acts as the representation to this infinite loop of question and answer produced by science.  Even the name of the story is based on this loop.  “Sic Semper, Sic Semper, Sic Semper” roughly translates to “Thus Always, Thus Always, Thus Always”, and is derived from the Latin phrase “Sic semper evello mortem tyrannis”, meaning “Thus always I bring death to tyrants”.  This is important because as the time traveler continually travels into his own skull, he must clear his skull of his brains, and thus kills himself every time.  So even though he is technically alive forever by becoming smaller and smaller, his other bodies must die off for him to continue living.  This means that even though the traveler seems to be running away from his own death, in reality he is killing himself in the process of running away.  I believe Warrick created this story to ask why humans are so afraid of death.  We are always running from it, creating machines to delay it, and dreaming of a future without death.  But the truth is by just existing we are slowly killing ourselves, and on occasion others around us.  Just like Warrick’s time traveler, we find excuses for us to run away from these problems that plague us instead of facing them, because just like the traveler, we’re afraid of what we don’t know.

                Chronic Argonauts is a short story written by H.G. Wells about time travel. It is a classic example of science fantasy; the author uses scientific lingos and terms but mainly focuses on supernatural aspect of time travel and scientific advancement. For example, when a hunchback Hughes dies near Dr. Nebogipel’s house, it seems that he died because of electrocution. However, the author describes as if he suddenly died with no apparent cause rather than giving scientific cause of his death. Another example can be found in last chapter. When the Reverend Cook meets Dr. Nebogipel, Dr. Nebogipel explains the theory behind the time travel. The author mentions words such as “quadridimensional geometry”, but does not specifically explain what it is. The focus of the story is that Dr. Nebogipel somehow invented a time travel machine.</p>
      	<p>What makes this story interesting is the sequence of the plot. The book is divided into four chapters, but these chapters are not in a chronological order. The chapter one introduces Dr. Nebogipel. However, the meeting with Dr. Nebogipel and Reverend Cook, which should come before the end of the chapter one where Dr. Nebogipel disappears with Reverend Cook, is chapter three and four; these two chapters explain how Reverend Cook meet with Dr. Nebogipel and why they disappeared. The end of the story is not chapter four, but chapter two in which Reverend Cook returns from time travel. Such random order of the story well fits the main theme of the book because it makes the readers to feel as if they did time travel.</p>
      	<p>The character development and the tone of the story shows how science and scientific inventions are regarded in the time of Wells. In chapter one, Dr. Nebogipel is clearly described as a scientist; however, people fear him and think he is a magician. The tone describing him is in the first chapter is very dark. However, in chapter three and four, the tone is brighter and Dr. Nebogipel is described as someone who is full of scientific enthusiasm. The misperception of Dr. Nebogipel is similar to that of Edison, one of the most famous scientist when the story was published . When Edison was gaining popularity, many people recognized him and his work as scientific but as magic by some people especially those who lived in rural area. (Willis) However, there are other arguments that Dr. Nebogipel symbolizes the embodiment of an image of future because he introduced himself as a man of the future and the projection of future humankind was common in 18th and 19th century.

                This short story has multiple elements that come together to form a decent representation of science fantasy. The most obvious scientific aspect is the suspended animation of the main character. Mira, and all of the other women in the dating center, are hooked up to advanced technology that can bring them back to consciousness and then “kill” them over and over again. The machines that run their lives (and deaths) are not described in much detail but are able to keep this cycle going for countless years.</p>
<p>The story is told from the point of view of Mira, who only knows what is going on when she is alive. Each time a man comes to visit her, the story continues. While she is alone, she is dead.  This is where the element of time travel is incorporated. It is a more subtle form of time travel compared to hopping in a time machine and going backwards or forwards to a specific year, but it can be put into this category as Mira is jumping ahead numerous years each time she wakes up. One time, Mira is awoken and hundreds of years have passed. She is met by a new face. This face is bright orange. While she does not know how long she was dead, she decides that people must be orange in the future.  This is the type of time travel used in Futurama, where a character is frozen and then wakes up years later.</p>
  <p>One of the main topics in the story is the relationship between Mira and her mother. In this world, when someone dies, if they cannot be frozen, their mind and soul can be placed into another person’s body. In Mira’s case, she is sharing her body with her mom. This form of immortality is called “hitching” and encapsulates the fantastic parts of the story. This causes a lot of internal conflict as Mira’s sexuality is not accepted by her mother. The topic of Mira’s sexuality is very important to the story as well, with most of Mira’s waking thoughts centered around her mother’s disapproval. It is interesting to note that the reason Mira killed herself is because she could not handle her mother constantly nagging her about being gay. In the end, she gets revived and her life is saved because she is a lesbian.</p>
<p>This story is a commentary on the social impacts of advancing technology. In this narrative, dating centers where women are held more or less against their will are commonplace. This could be a shot at real world human trafficking and the use of the internet that aides in these activities. In the story, the only way to get your life back is to convince a rich man that you are willing to marry him. In most cases, the marriages occur in the dating centers, before the woman is fully revived to ensure her cooperation. While this dark world building is downplayed by the cute love story that takes place between Mira and her deceased girlfriend Jeanette, the importance of the commentary is not lost.
